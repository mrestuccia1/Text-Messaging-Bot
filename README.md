# Text-Messaging-Bot
An app which takes in an excel file with phone numbers and sends a text message of your choice to all of them. I built this for a club I am in, to easily send communications to everyone.

This was built using Python, Flask, the Twilio API, and deployed using Heroku.

## Note
Since the Twilio API costs money, I unsubscribed once I  didn't need this system anymore. Therefore, this can't be run. However, please take a look at the code!
